\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
This report gives a short review of Hurvich's (1989) Regression and time series model selection in small samples and presents an application of $AIC_C$ on linear regression model selection. Based on those results, we find that $AIC_C$ provides the best selections among various criteria under the condition of small sample linear regression. In the simulation part, we see that $AIC_C$ seems always performs better than $AIC$, no matter when the sample size is small or large. We are wondering whether can we replace $AIC$ with $AIC_C$. However, the performance of criteria can be influenced by many conditions, for example, the parameters we used in dataset generation, the type of model and selection method we used.
